15WebServ
=========
A simple webserver written in c#.

It doesn't use the default http engine, it uses an own engline written from scratch.

It currently fully supports HTTP/0.9 and, of course HTTP/1.x simple requests (wich are handled the same way as HTTP/0.9 requests).

It is currently in an early state of development!
